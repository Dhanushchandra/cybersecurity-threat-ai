# 🚀 AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System

This project uses **Machine Learning & Security Logs** to detect cyber threats in real time.  
It classifies **intrusions, malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks** using AI.

---

## 🔹 Features
✅ AI-powered **intrusion detection**  
✅ Detects **malware, phishing, DDoS attacks**  
✅ Uses **Splunk, TensorFlow, AWS Security**  
✅ Live dashboard for **real-time threat monitoring**  

---

## 🔹 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ **Clone the repository:**
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/mahasweta99/cybersecurity-threat-ai.git
   cd cybersecurity-threat-ai
   ```

2️⃣ **Install dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3️⃣ **Run data preprocessing:**
   ```cmd
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```

---

## 🔹 Data Preprocessing
🔹 Loads security logs (`data/security_logs.csv`)  
🔹 Cleans missing data & formats timestamps  
🔹 Extracts important **threat features**  

**Run the script:**
```cmd
python src/preprocess.py
```

---

## 🔹 Model Training
🔹 Trains a **Machine Learning model** to classify security threats.  
🔹 Uses **Random Forest, Deep Learning (TensorFlow), Anomaly Detection**.  
🔹 Saves trained models to `models/` directory.  

**Run the script:**
```cmd
python src/train.py
```

---

## 🔹 Threat Prediction (Real-Time)
🔹 Uses trained AI model to analyze new security logs.  
🔹 Outputs **predicted threat categories** (e.g., "Phishing", "DDoS", "Normal").  

**Run the script:**
```cmd
python src/predict.py
```

---

## 🔹 Deployment
This system is deployed as a **Flask API** for real-time security threat analysis.  

**Start the API server:**
```cmd
python src/deploy.py
```

**Test the API with sample input:**
```cmd
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"log": "Suspicious login attempt detected"}' http://localhost:5000/predict
```
