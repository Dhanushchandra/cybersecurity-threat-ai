# 🚀 AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System

This project uses **Machine Learning & Security Logs** to detect cyber threats in real time.  
It classifies **intrusions, malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks** using AI.

---

## 🔹 Features
✅ AI-powered **intrusion detection**  
✅ Detects **malware, phishing, DDoS attacks**  
✅ Uses **Splunk, TensorFlow, AWS Security**  
✅ Live dashboard for **real-time threat monitoring**  

---

## 🔹 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ **Clone the repository:**
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/mahasweta99/cybersecurity-threat-ai.git
   cd cybersecurity-threat-ai

---
2️⃣ **Install dependencies:**
     ```cmd
    pip install -r requirements.txt
---

3️⃣ **Run data preprocessing:**

    python src/preprocess.py

---
##🔹 Data Preprocessing
  🔹 Loads security logs (data/security_logs.csv)
  🔹 Cleans missing data & formats timestamps
  🔹 Extracts important threat features

    ```cmd
    python src/preprocess.py

---

##🔹 Model Training
  🔹 Trains a Machine Learning model to classify security threats.
  🔹 Uses Random Forest, Deep Learning (TensorFlow), Anomaly Detection.
  🔹 Saves trained models to models/ directory.
---

    ```cmd
    python src/train.py
---

##🔹 Threat Prediction (Real-Time)
  🔹 Uses trained AI model to analyze new security logs.
  🔹 Outputs predicted threat categories (e.g., "Phishing", "DDoS", "Normal").

    ```cmd
    python src/predict.py

##🔹 Deployment
This system is deployed as a Flask API for real-time security threat analysis.

Start the API server:

    ```cmd
    python src/deploy.py
    
Test the API with sample input:

    ```cmd
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"log": "Suspicious login attempt detected"}' ht

## Setup Instructions  
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/mahasweta99/cybersecurity-threat-ai.git
cd cybersecurity-threat-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
